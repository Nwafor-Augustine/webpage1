                Michael Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, one of James and Deloris
                Jordan's five children.
                The family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, when Michael was very young. His father worked as a
                General Electric
                plant supervisor, and his mother worked at a bank. His father taught him to work hard and not to be
                tempted by street
                life. His mother taught him to sew, clean, and do laundry. Jordan loved sports but failed to make
                his high school
                basketball team as a sophomore. He continued to practice and made the team the next year. After high
                school he accepted
                a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina, where he played under head coach Dean
                Smith.

                In Jordan's first season at North Carolina he was named Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of
                the Year for 1982. The
                team won the ACC championship, and Jordan made the clutch jump shot that beat Georgetown University
                for the championship
                of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Jordan led the ACC in scoring as a sophomore
                and as a junior.
                The Sporting News named him college player of the year for both years. He left North Carolina after
                his junior year and
                was selected by the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) as the third pick of
                the 1984 draft.
                Before joining the Bulls, Jordan was a member of the Summer 1984 United States Olympic basketball
                team that won the gold
                medal in Los Angeles, California.
